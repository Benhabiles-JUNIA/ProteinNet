# ProteinNet
Deep learning based protein characterization from 3D point clouds.

This project has been developed in the frame of the SHREC 2021 contest http://shrec2021.drugdesign.fr/. It consists of proposing approaches for indexing proteins from 3d shapes in the form of point cloud and associated metadata. The developed approach exploits deep learning techniques to characterize protein shape. In particular, the approach includes a data normalization module by realigning the 3D coordinates of the proteins.
